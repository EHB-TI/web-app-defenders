# Goal
*describe how this web app will (evantually) earn money or make the world a better place*

Having a blog allows you to express yourself, as well as inspire and educate others on a variety of topics. It's one of the most effective methods to establish an online presence and share your expertise with people around the world. However, starting a blog can be very overwhelming. As a result, our team will develop a GDPR-compliant, secure blogging platform for people to share their expertise and thoughts. The web app will have a user-friendly interface that allows users to register or log in, create blog entries, add photos, and like and comment on other users' postings. In addition, one of the most useful features of our web app will be the ability to collaborate on blogs up to more than one person. As the group's administrator, you will be able to invite other members to contribute to the post, which makes our app an excellent tool for any business.
